# Procedural Grid-Based Tile Collapsing with Constraint Propagation

This project is a procedural generation tool based on tile collapsing, similar to the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. It uses predefined rules to propagate constraints across a grid and generate unique patterns by limiting options based on neighboring cells.

### 1. Overview

The code initializes a grid and applies procedural constraints to generate a pattern. Each cell has several possible states represented by images and constraints for neighboring cells. As the program runs, it selects cells with minimal options, collapses them to a single state, and then updates neighboring cells' options.

### 2. Features

- Grid-based procedural generation.
- Constraint propagation based on predefined rules.
- Random selection of cell options to create dynamic patterns.
- Visualization of cell states with unique images.
- Interactive interface with a `mousePressed` reset option.

### 3. Folder Structure

The folder should contain the following structure:
```
project-folder/
├── index.html          # Entry point for the project
├── sketch.js           # Main code file
└── tile/
    ├── empty.jpg       # Image for the "BLANK" tile
    ├── up.jpg          # Image for the "UP" tile
    ├── right.jpg       # Image for the "RIGHT" tile
    ├── down.jpg        # Image for the "DOWN" tile
    └── left.jpg        # Image for the "LEFT" tile
```

### 4. Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Set up images** in the `tile` folder as shown above.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the visual representation of the grid generation.

### 5. Code Explanation

- **Grid Initialization**: A `DIM` by `DIM` grid is initialized where each cell has multiple possible states (`BLANK`, `UP`, `RIGHT`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`).
- **Rules**: Each cell state has predefined rules determining which neighboring states are valid.
- **Drawing**: Cells display different images based on their current state and options available.
- **Collapsing and Propagation**:
  - The algorithm selects cells with the fewest options and collapses them to a single option.
  - The options of neighboring cells are then updated based on predefined rules to propagate constraints.

### 6. How It Works

- The `draw()` loop continuously updates and displays the grid.
- Each cell starts with all options (`BLANK`, `UP`, `RIGHT`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`).
- **Collapse and Constraint Propagation**:
  - In each step, the algorithm selects cells with the fewest remaining options and collapses them by choosing one of their options.
  - The grid updates neighboring cells' options based on the selected cell's state using `checkValid()` and `rules`.
  - The process repeats until all cells are collapsed.

### 7. Rules and Options

Each tile (or cell state) has a rule specifying compatible states for each direction:
- **rules[0]**: Rules for `BLANK` tiles.
- **rules[1]**: Rules for `UP` tiles.
- **rules[2]**: Rules for `RIGHT` tiles.
- **rules[3]**: Rules for `DOWN` tiles.
- **rules[4]**: Rules for `LEFT` tiles.

Each rule ensures that only compatible states can be selected for neighboring cells in each direction (up, right, down, left), creating cohesive patterns.

### 8. Further Exploration

- **Experiment with DIM**: Adjust the `DIM` variable to control grid size.
- **Change Images**: Update tile images for different visual effects.
- **Extend Rules**: Add new tile types or adjust rules to generate different types of patterns.

This code serves as an introduction to tile-based procedural generation and constraint propagation, which can be extended or customized for various applications in games, design, and simulations.
